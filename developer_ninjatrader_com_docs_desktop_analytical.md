NinjaScript provides a number of methods and properties useful for analyzing and identifying specific conditions within **Series `<t>`** collections. Some of these methods test a condition and return true or false, while others return an int-based bar index or other numerical value. A list of analytical methods can be found below:

| Methods and Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CountIf()](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/countif) | Counts the number of occurrences of the test condition |
| [CrossAbove()](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/crossabove) | Evaluates a cross above condition |
| [CrossBelow()](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/crossbelow) | Evaluates a cross below condition |
| [GetCurrentAsk()](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/getcurrentask) | Returns the current Ask price |
| [GetCurrentAskVolume()](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/getcurrentaskvolume) | Returns the current Ask volume |
| [GetCurrentBid()](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/getcurrentbid) | Returns the current Bid price |
| [GetCurrentBidVolume()](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/getcurrentbidvolume) | Returns the current Bid volume |
| [GetMedian()](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/getmedian) | Returns the median value of the specified series |
| [HighestBar()](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/highestbar) | Returns the number of bars ago the highest price value occurred |
| [IsFalling()](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/isfalling) | Evaluates a falling condition |
| [IsRising()](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/isrising) | Evaluates a rising condition |
| [Least Recent Occurrence (LRO)](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/least_recent_occurrence_lro) | Returns the number of bars ago that the least recent occurrence of a test condition evaluated to true |
| [LowestBar()](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/lowestbar) | Returns the number of bars ago the lowest price value occurred |
| [Most Recent Occurrence (MRO)](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/most_recent_occurrence_mro) | Returns the number of bars ago that the most recent occurrence of a test condition evaluated to true |
| [Slope()](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/slope) | Returns a measurement of the steepness of a price series measured by the change over time |
| [TickSize](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/ticksize) | The value of 1 tick for the corresponding instrument |
| [ToDay()](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/today) | Calculates an integer value representing a date |
| [ToTime()](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/totime) | Calculates an integer value representing a time |
