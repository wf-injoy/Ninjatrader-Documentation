## [Definition](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/axisxheight\#definition)

Measures the distance (in pixels) between the x-axis and the top of the horizontal scroll bar near the bottom of the chart.

## [Property Value](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/axisxheight\#property-value)

A double representing the number of pixels separating the x-axis and the top of the horizontal scroll bar on the chart.

## [Syntax](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/axisxheight\#syntax)

`ChartControl.AxisXHeight`

## [Example](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/axisxheight\#example)

```jsx-150469391 csharp
protected override void OnRender(ChartControl chartControl, ChartScale chartScale)
{
     // Print the number of pixels between the x-axis and the top of the horizontal scrollbar
     double height = chartControl.AxisXHeight;
     Print(height);
}

```

Based on the image below, AxisXHeight reveals that the space between the x-axis and the top of the horizontal scrollbar is 31 pixels on this chart.
