## [Definition](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/timeinforce\#definition)

Sets the time in force property for all orders generated by a strategy. The selected TIF parameter is sent to your broker on order submission and will instruct how long you would like the order to be active before it is cancelled.

## Note

This property is dependent on what time in force your broker may or may not support. If a brokerage / exchange combination is not compatible with a particular time in force, the order will be rejected by the broker. NinjaTrader does not have a method to prevent an unsupported TIF to be sent to a particular exchange. For questions about what TIF may be supported, please contact your broker directly.

## [Property Value](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/timeinforce\#property-value)

An enum value that determines the time in force. Default value is set to **TimeInForce.Gtc**. Possible values are:

| **TimeInForce.Day** | Orders will be canceled by the broker at the end of the trading session |
| **TimeInForce.Gtc** | Order will remain working until the order is explicitly cancelled. |
| **TimeInForce.Gtd** | Order will remain working until the specified date |

## [Syntax](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/timeinforce\#syntax)

`TimeInForce`

## [Examples](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/timeinforce\#examples)

### **Setting default TIF for all strategy orders**

```jsx-150469391 csharp
protected override void OnStateChange()
{
     if (State == State.SetDefaults)
     {
         TimeInForce = TimeInForce.Day;
     }
}

```

### **Setting TIF conditionally**

```jsx-150469391 csharp
protected override void OnStateChange()
{
     if (State == State.Configure)
     {
         if (Instrument != null)
         {
             if (Instrument.Exchange == Exchange.Nybot)
                 TimeInForce = TimeInForce.Day;
             else if (Instrument.Exchange == Exchange.Globex)
                 TimeInForce = TimeInForce.Gtc;
         }
     }
}

```
