Please refer to the official SharpDX Documentation for additional members not covered in this reference. For more seasoned graphic developers, the original MSDN **Direct2D1** and **DirectWrite** unmanaged API documentation can also be helpful for understanding the DirectX/Direct2D run-time environment. For NinjaScript development purposes, we document only essential members in the structure of this page.

## [Definition](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_gradientstopcollection_gradientstopcount\#definition)

For an **LinearGradientBrush**, the brush's content area is the gradient axis. For a **RadialGradientBrush**, the brush's content is the area within the gradient ellipse.

## [Property Value](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_gradientstopcollection_gradientstopcount\#property-value)

An **int** value representing the number of gradient stops in the collection.
