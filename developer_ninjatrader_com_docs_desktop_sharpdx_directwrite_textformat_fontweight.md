Please refer to the official SharpDX Documentation for additional members not covered in this reference. For more seasoned graphic developers, the original MSDN **Direct2D1** and **DirectWrite** unmanaged API documentation can also be helpful for understanding the DirectX/Direct2D run-time environment.

## [Definition](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_directwrite_textformat_fontweight\#definition)

Gets the font weight of the text.

(See also [unmanaged API documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd316652.aspx))

## Note

Notes:

1. Weight differences are generally differentiated by an increased stroke or thickness that is associated with a given character in a typeface, as compared to a "normal" character from that same typeface.
2. Not all weights are available for all typefaces. When a weight is not available for a typeface, the closest matching weight is returned.
3. Font weight values less than 1 or greater than 999 are considered invalid, and they are rejected by font API functions.

## [Property Value](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_directwrite_textformat_fontweight\#property-value)

A **SharpDX.DirectWrite.FontWeight** enum value that indicates the type of weight (such as normal, bold, or black). See table below.

## [Syntax](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_directwrite_textformat_fontweight\#syntax)
