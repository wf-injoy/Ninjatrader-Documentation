## [Getting indicator values from a specified time](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/getting-indicator-values-from-a-specified-time\#getting-indicator-values-from-a-specified-time)

Sometimes, you may want to access a value from a historical point in time, but have not kept track of the value to make this readily available. With **NinjaScript**, it is possible to pick a bar based on time to access that value. **GetBar()** returns the number of bars ago that holds the same timestamp of the time you request. This sample demonstrates how to get an indicator value from 9:30AM of the previous trading day.
