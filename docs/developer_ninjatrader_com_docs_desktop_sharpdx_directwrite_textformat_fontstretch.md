Please refer to the official SharpDX Documentation for additional members not covered in this reference.

## [Definition](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_directwrite_textformat_fontstretch\#definition)

Gets the font stretch of the text.

(See also [unmanaged API documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd316646.aspx))

## Note

1. A font stretch describes the degree to which a font form is stretched from its normal aspect ratio, which is the original width to height ratio specified for the glyphs in the font.
2. Values other than the ones defined in the enumeration are considered to be invalid, and are rejected by font API functions.

## [Property Value](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_directwrite_textformat_fontstretch\#property-value)

A **SharpDX.DirectWrite.FontStretch** enum value which indicates the type of font stretch (such as normal or condensed). See table below.
