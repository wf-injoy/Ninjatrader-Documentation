The SharpDX.Direct2D1 namespace provides a managed Direct2D API. Direct2D is a hardware-accelerated, immediate-mode, 2-D graphics API that provides high performance and high-quality rendering for 2-D geometry, bitmaps, and text.

| Member | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AntialiasMode](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_antialiasmode) | Specifies how the edges of nontext primitives are rendered. |
| [ArcSegment](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_arcsegment) | Describes an elliptical arc between two points. |
| [ArcSize](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_arcsize) | Specifies whether an arc should be greater than 180 degrees. |
| [Brush](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_brush) | Defines an object that paints an area. Interfaces that derive from Brush describe how the area is painted. |
| [BrushProperties](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_brushproperties) | Describes the opacity and transformation of a brush. |
| [DrawTextOptions](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_drawtextoptions) | Specifies whether text snapping is suppressed or clipping to the layout rectangle is enabled. This enumeration allows a bitwise combination of its member values. |
| [Ellipse](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_ellipse) | Contains the center point, x-radius, and y-radius of an ellipse. |
| [FigureBegin](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_figurebegin) | Indicates whether a specific GeometrySink figure is filled or hollow. |
| [FigureEnd](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_figureend) | Indicates whether a specific GeometrySink figure is open or closed. |
| [FillMode](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_fillmode) | Specifies how the intersecting areas of geometries or figures are combined to form the area of the composite geometry. |
| [GeometrySink](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_geometrysink) | Describes a geometric path that can contain lines, arcs, cubic Bezier curves, and quadratic Bezier curves. |
| [MeasuringMode](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_measuringmode) | Indicates the measuring method used for **text layout**. |
| [PathGeometry](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_pathgeometry) | Represents a complex shape that may be composed of arcs, curves, and lines. |
| [RenderTarget](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_rendertarget) | Represents an object that can receive drawing commands. |
| [SolidColorBrush](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_solidcolorbrush) | Paints an area with a solid color. |
| [StrokeStyle](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_strokestyle) | Describes the caps, miter limit, line join, and dash information for a stroke. |
| [SweepDirection](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_sweepdirection) | Defines the direction that an elliptical arc is drawn. |
