Please refer to the official SharpDX Documentation for additional members not covered in this reference.

For NinjaScript development purposes, we document only essential members in the structure of this page.

## [Definition](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_gradientstopcollection_colorinterpolationgamma\#definition)

Indicates the gamma space in which the gradient stops are interpolated.

(See also **unmanaged API documentation**)

## Note

Interpolating in a linear gamma space ( **Gamma.Linear**) can avoid changes in perceived brightness caused by the effect of gamma correction in spaces where the gamma is not 1.0, such as the default sRGB color space, where the gamma is 2.2.

## [Property Value](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_gradientstopcollection_colorinterpolationgamma\#property-value)

A **SharpDX.Direct2D1.Gamma** enum value specifies which gamma is used for interpolation.

Possible values include:

| StandardRgb | Interpolation is performed in the standard RGB (sRGB) gamma. |
| Linear | Interpolation is performed in the linear-gamma color space. |

(see also **unmanaged API documentation**)

## [Syntax](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_gradientstopcollection_colorinterpolationgamma\#syntax)

`<gradientstopcollection>.ColorInterpolationGamma`
