Please refer to the official SharpDX Documentation for additional members not covered in this reference. For more seasoned graphic developers, the original MSDN **Direct2D1** and **DirectWrite** unmanaged API documentation can also be helpful for understanding the DirectX/Direct2D run-time environment. For NinjaScript development purposes, we document only essential members in the structure of this page.

## [Definition](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_pathgeometry_getbounds\#definition)

Retrieves the bounds of the geometry.

(See also [unmanaged API documentation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd742751.aspx))

## [Method Return Value](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_pathgeometry_getbounds\#method-return-value)

A **SharpDX.RectangleF** which contains the bounds of this geometry. If the bounds are empty, this will be a rect where bounds.left > bounds.right.

## [Syntax](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_pathgeometry_getbounds\#syntax)

<pathgeometry\`>.GetBounds()

## [Parameters](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_direct2d1_pathgeometry_getbounds\#parameters)

This method does not accept any parameters.
