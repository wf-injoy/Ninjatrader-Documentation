## [Error Code Explanation](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/cs0234\#error-code-explanation)

This error can occur when an imported DLL (could be a 3rd party indicator) you are referencing no longer exists / has been removed.

To resolve this the DLL must be re-imported.

**To re-import a 3rd party dll:**

1. Open the **NinjaScript Editor** via **New > NinjaScript editor**.
2. Right mouse click in the **NinjaScript Editor** main window and select the menu name **"References"**.
3. In the **"References"** dialog window press the button **"Add"**.
4. Select the 3rd party DLL.

## Warning

- Please make sure in this step to select only the 'true' DLL file needed for reference, which would not contain any X86 or X64 suffixes in its file-name, otherwise you could run into compile issues later.
