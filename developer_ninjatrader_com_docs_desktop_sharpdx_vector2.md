Please refer to the official SharpDX Documentation for additional members not covered in this reference. For more seasoned graphic developers, the original MSDN **Direct2D1** and **DirectWrite** unmanaged API documentation can also be helpful for understanding the DirectX/Direct2D run-time environment. For NinjaScript development purposes, we document only essential members in the structure of this page.

## [Definition](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_vector2\#definition)

Represents a two dimensional mathematical vector.

## [Syntax](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_vector2\#syntax)

`struct Vector2`

## Note

For NinjaScript Development Purposes, you can use the **NinjaTrader.Gui.DxExtensions.ToVector2()** helper method to convert a **System.Windows.Point** structure to a **SharpDX.Vector2** used for SharpDX rendering.

## [Constructors](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_vector2\#constructors)

| Constructor | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Vector2()** | Initializes a new instance of the Vector2 struct. |
| **Vector2(float x, float y)** | Initializes a new instance of the Vector2 struct using float values for x and y components. |

## [Properties](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_vector2\#properties)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **X** | A float for the X component of the vector. |
| **Y** | A float for the Y component of the vector. |
