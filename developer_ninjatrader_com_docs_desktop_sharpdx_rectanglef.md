## [Definition](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_rectanglef\#definition)

Structure using similar layout as **System.Drawing.RectangleF**.

## Note

This structure is slightly different from **System.Drawing.RectangleF** as it is internally storing Left, Top, Right, Bottom instead of Left, Top, Width, Height. Although automatic casting from a to **System.Drawing.Rectangle** is provided.

## [Syntax](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_rectanglef\#syntax)

`struct RectangleF`

| new **RectangleF**() | Initializes a new instance of the **RectangleF** struct. |
| new **RectangleF**(float x, float y, float width, float height) | Initializes a new instance of the **RectangleF** with specific dimensions. |

## [Properties](https://developer.ninjatrader.com/docs/desktop/sharpdx_rectanglef\#properties)
